# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.


## Description of the project:
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
For each mile_stone code will be used a buidling block to create an actual hangman game by creating a list of word,
randomly generate a word and ask for user input with conditional statement for mile_stone_2.

For mile_stone_3 code had some added function for ask_input_(guess), used to see if user entered a valid letter,
and check_guess(guess) function to adjust the user input and check if the letter is in word_list. Main point of function
is capsulate the information in a neater and clearer OOP design.

As for Mile_stone_4 code gets a bit complex as it uses the class hangman to iterate certain value and setting needed for the 
hangman game. Such as  num_lives to count the user remaining lives, adjust num_letters remiang in word_guessed. 
## Installations instruction:
correctly in the person of making the scripts, so there is nothing to install at this point.
## Usage instructions:
Simply game where a user inputs a word to be guessed and try to make sure the the Hangman is not formed each time you guess a letter, else the person would lose the game.
