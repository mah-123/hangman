# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.


## Description of the project:
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
For each milestone code will be used a buidling block to create an actual hangman game by creating a list of word,
randomly generate a word and ask for user input with conditional statement by progressing each step.

* milestone_2: Create a import random to use choice, a list of words and taking in user input to be validated.
* milestone_3: Added two functions ask_input_(guess)and check_guess(guess) to validate user input and check if the single character is in the chosen word
* milestone_4: Class Hangman contains self initialise such as num_lives to count the user remaining lives, adjust num_letters remiang in word_guessed.
* User can type help(Hangman) for a full description. 
* mile_stone5: code is the improved version of the last milestone by adding another function  play_game, which allows a user to play the game.
